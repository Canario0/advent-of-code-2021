Repository of solutions for the [Advent of Code 2021][4] done by [Canario0][1]

This year I want to keep testing/learning Typescript with deno [Deno][2]. Check the
repository of the [Advent of Code 2020][9].

## Usage

### Prerequisites

You may need to [install deno][3] to use this repository.

Some of the test need `--allow-read` to read the sample inputs of its day.
